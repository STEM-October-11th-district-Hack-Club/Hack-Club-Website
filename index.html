        <h1>What We Do</h1>
        <p>Our club hosts a variety of hands-on activities — from beginner-friendly workshops to full-scale hackathons — where members can collaborate, build, and showcase their skills.</p>
        <p>Every week, our members dive into coding challenges, design sessions, and collaborative projects that stretch their skills and spark new ideas. Whether you're a total beginner or an experienced coder, you'll find a place to learn, build, and grow.</p>
        <p>We also organize events like the <span>STEM School Hackathon</span>, themed workshops, and build days where members create websites, games, apps, hardware hacks, and more.</p>
